# Assignment 1 - 2/7/2022

**Why you are taking this course?**
I'm taking this course because it is a prerequisite for the spring modeling course, and I just want to make sure there aren't any gaps in my knowledge of the basics. I also want a general refresher in base R and making loops.

**Describe your data science background**
I have a good amount of experience working in R, making visualizations, functions, loops and cleaning big data sets. I also have some experience in Python, C++, JavaScript and SQL. I'm comfortable with the basic functions in GitHub but don't know how to work branches, projects or some of the other options available.
